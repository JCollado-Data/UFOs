# UFOs
JavaScript project

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to implement js, html, and css. We evaluated data scraped from the web to identify UFO sightings. 

## Results
When operating the webpage, you would be able to edit the search criteria. Simply input the search information on the left and hit enter. This will modify the search engine and produce customer results.

## Summary
The website is very basic and the information is stored in a local db. For the site to update data will need to be manually updated. Additionally, I would add more visuals to make the website more appealing.
